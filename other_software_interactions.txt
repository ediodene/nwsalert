NWS Web Servers
	
	Find your NWS Office's HWO statement URL and customize the script's CURL statement to download theirs to parse.  There may be variations of

SSMTP + google e-mail account

	This setup requires the SSMTP package to be loaded and configured with your own e-mail address.
	Google has made security changes to their systems that require registration of applications to 
	increase security using imap and TLS.  Be sure to set that up with your e-mail account.  Obviously
	I will NOT publish that here. I have provided scrubbed examples of the config files that are found
	in /etc/ssmtp for refference.  More information at https://support.google.com on setting up apps
	and devices to sent e-mail using google's relays in a more secure manner.
